      # The service will define the Gateway EUI based on a network interface: eth0, wlan0 or usb0.
      # If neither of these exist or you want it to use a different interface you can define the NIC this way:
      #GATEWAY_EUI_NIC: "eth0"

      # You can also set a custom Gateway EUI (8 bytes in hex format)
      #GATEWAY_EUI: "1122334455667788"

      # The default LNS server is the European TTN server. 
      # If you still want to use TTN but a different region you can set it this way:
      #TTN_REGION: "eu1"

      # Or you can set a completely different LNS server.
      #SERVER_HOST: eu1.cloud.thethings.network
      #SERVER_PORT: 1700

      # The default frequency band is EU868, 
      # if your module uses a different band you have to select it here:
      #BAND: "eu_863_870"

      # If you want the gateway to report a specific lat/lon/alt you can set them this way:
      #GPS_LATITUDE: 41.42
      #GPS_LONGITUDE: 2.12
      #GPS_ALTITUDE: 0
